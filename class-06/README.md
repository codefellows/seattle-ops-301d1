# Windows Server 

Today you will deploy AD DC and DNS packages on a new GUI-enabled (desktop experience) Windows Server 2016 box in GNS3. You’ll do some network IP housekeeping, establish the FQDN, and join the existing Win 10 PC to the domain. You’ll move the primary DNS on this topology to the Windows Server 2016 machine moving forward, for optimal compatibility and administration.
