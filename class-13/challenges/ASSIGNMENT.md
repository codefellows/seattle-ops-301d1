# Ops Challenge: Python Requests Library

## Overview

Ever wondered how web browsers like Google Chrome communicate with web servers to create the interactive web sites and apps we use every day? One technical answer is HTTP requests. Today, you will be performing HTTP GET requests using the "requests" Python library. This library is very useful for a security professional to evaluate how a web server responds to outside requests.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Using the requests library, perform a GET requests against your lab web server. In your script, analyze and interpret the codes. Translate the codes into plain terms; for example, a '404' error should print 'Site not found' to the terminal instead of '404'.

Add the below information as comments:

- Script Name
- Author
- Date of last revision
- Description of purpose
- Declaration of variables
- Declaration of functions
- Main
- End 

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.
