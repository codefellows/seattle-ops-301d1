# Ops Challenge: Functions

## Overview

Functions are universally useful across all coding languages for their role as a subroutine within a script that can accept input parameters. Today, you will be creating a Python script that utilizes a function from the os library to generate directory information.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Create a Python script that generates all directories, sub-directories and files for a user input path.
- Script must use the `os.walk()` function from the os library.
- Have the script save the output as a .txt file.
- Have the script open the .txt file with Libre Office Writer.

Add the below information as comments:

- Script Name
- Author
- Date of last revision
- Description of purpose
- Declaration of variables
- Declaration of functions
- Main
- End

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

Create a Python script that includes the following:
- Takes a user input string
- Creates a directory named the string using `os.makdirs` function
- Create sub-directories within the directory named 'string_01', 'string_02', and 'string_03'

## Submission Instructions

- When you are ready to submit your shell script for grading, copy your script to a new file in your **public** [Github](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} repository. Name the file according to your cose code and assignment, e.g. `ops-301d1: Challenge 01`.
- Copy the URL to your Github file and paste below as your submission. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
    - A question within the context of today's lab assignment
    - An observation about the lab assignment, or related 'Ah-hah!' moment
    - How long you spent working on this assignment
