# Ops Challenge: Sendmail

## Overview

In 1979, Eric Allman wrote the original ARPANET delivermail, one of the earliest forms of email ever developed. Allman went on to write Sendmail in the early 80s at UC Berkeley. Sendmail shipped with BSD in 1983. By 1996, 80% of internet mail servers used Sendmail to deliver email. The ability to send email from a Linux server is useful for notifying administrators of events taking place on the server. In today's Ops Challenge, you will be installing Sendmail on your Ubuntu Linux VM and using it to send emails via SMTP protocol.
