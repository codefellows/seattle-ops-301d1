# Linux Web Server

Web application security is a major focal point in modern cybersecurity. Understanding how web sites and web apps are hosted is essential to an administrator of infrastructure systems. Today you will deploy and configure a locally-hosted Linux web server. You will be loading up Ubuntu Server with an Apache web server package and tinker with the backend HTML to generate a fully operational web server within GNS3. The new web server will be accessible at port 80 from the internet.
