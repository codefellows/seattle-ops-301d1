# Ops Challenge: Python File Handling

## Overview

Today, you will be using Python's file handling capabilities to open and manipulate an existing file. This can be useful in generating log files or working with CSV or JSON data files.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Using file handling commands, create a Python script that creates a new .txt file, appends three lines, prints to the screen the first line, then deletes the .txt file.

Add the below information as comments:

- Script Name
- Author
- Date of last revision
- Description of purpose
- Declaration of variables
- Declaration of functions
- Main
- End 

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

- Have your Python script open the CSV or JSON of your Azure AD Audit Log and return customized information from it, such as a filtered view of most important information.

## Submission Instructions

- When you are ready to submit your shell script for grading, copy your script to a new file in your **public** [Github](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} repository. Name the file according to your cose code and assignment, e.g. `ops-301d1: Challenge 01`.
- Copy the URL to your Github file and paste below as your submission. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
    - A question within the context of today's lab assignment
    - An observation about the lab assignment, or related 'Ah-hah!' moment
    - How long you spent working on this assignment
