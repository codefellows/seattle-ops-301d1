# DevOps

## Overview

DevOps leverages scripting to automate operations for the delivery of applications and services more efficiently and with less administrative overhead. Traditionally, developers and ops teams are siloed; however using a DevOps philosophy, developer skillsets can be integrated to spin up infrastructure using modern tools like Chef, Puppet, and Vagrant in order to meet market demand with higher agility. If you've heard of "infrastracture as code" or "microservices" then you've heard of DevOps. Today, you'll use Vagrant to deploy a Linux web server.
