# Ops Challenge: Python Collections

## Overview

Python is known for its relevance to data science and consequently handles data quite well using collections (arrays). Today, you will be creating lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Create a Python script that includes the following:
- A list of ten string elements.
- Print the fourth element of the list.
- Print the second and third element of the list.
- Print the first through fifth element of the list.
- Print the sixth through tenth element of the list.
- Change the value of the seventh element to "onion".
- A loop that prints each element of the list.
- Print the length of the list.
- Remove the second item of the list.

Use the below Python methods once each against your list to manipulate the elements in your list:
```
append()
clear()
copy()
count()
extend()
index()
insert()
pop()
remove()
reverse()
sort()
```
Create one tuple. 
Create one set.
create one dictionary.

Add the below information as comments:

- Script Name
- Author
- Date of last revision
- Description of purpose
- Declaration of variables
- Declaration of functions
- Main
- End 

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

## Submission Instructions

- When you are ready to submit your shell script for grading, copy your script to a new file in your **public** [Github](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} repository. Name the file according to your cose code and assignment, e.g. `ops-301d1: Challenge 01`.
- Copy the URL to your Github file and paste below as your submission. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
    - A question within the context of today's lab assignment
    - An observation about the lab assignment, or related 'Ah-hah!' moment
    - How long you spent working on this assignment
