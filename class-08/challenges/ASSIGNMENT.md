# Ops Challenge: Python Loops 

## Overview

Loops are useful for repeating an operation. There are several ways to create loops in Python. Today, you will be writing your own loops.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Create a Python script that features the below:

- T01: A for loop that iterates through each letter of the string "codefellows" and prints each letter
- T02: Copy T01; add a `break` statement to the five-element list loop to stop after the third element prints
- T03: Copy T01; add a `continue` statement to the five-element list loop to skip printing the second element
- T04: A for loop that uses the `range()` function on a single integer argument
- T05: A for loop that uses the 'else' keyword to print a message when the loop is finished
- T06: An infinite while loop that prints a string
- T07: A while loop that prints a string three times
- T08: Copy T8; add a `break` statement to stop after the second print
- T09: Copy T8; add a `continue` statement to skip the second print
- T10: Copy T8; ad an `else` statement to print a message when the loop is finished

For each loop comment in your own words how the loop works.

Add the below information as comments:

- Script Name
- Author
- Date of last revision
- Description of purpose
- Declaration of variables
- Declaration of functions
- Main
- End 

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

Add to the Python script:
- A nested loop using two lists of integers

## Submission Instructions

- When you are ready to submit your shell script for grading, copy your script to a new file in your **public** [Github](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} repository. Name the file according to your cose code and assignment, e.g. `ops-301d1: Challenge 01`.
- Copy the URL to your Github file and paste below as your submission. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
    - A question within the context of today's lab assignment
    - An observation about the lab assignment, or related 'Ah-hah!' moment
    - How long you spent working on this assignment
